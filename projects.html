        <h1>Wave Machine: Determining the sea conditions for cargo ships</h1>

	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p class ="lead"> This project aims to extract the sea
	conditions that a cargo ship is experiencing using time series
	data from 4 different draft sensors installed in the ship. The
	draft sensors provide water depth information at each position
	of the ship where the corresponding sensor is
	installed. Currently the sea conditions are daily reported by
	the captain, and the goal of this project is to build a model
	to automate the captain's report on the sea conditions using the
	draft sensor data.</p>

	<p class ="lead">This information on the sea conditions would
	eventually allow a maritime consulting company to make
	suggestions for how the ship can burn less fuel. </p>

	<h2>1. What are the sea conditions?</h2>
        <p class="lead"> The sea conditions are determined by two
        parameters, Swell and Sea State. Swell is given by large wave
        structure (imagine there's a hurricane far away and a big wave
        propagates to where the ship is). Sea state is about the
        choppiness of the water surface where the ship is. For
        example, local wind can generate ripples at the sea surface
        around the ship and it can change the Sea State. Fig. 1 shows
        a cartoon describing the Swell and Sea State shown in red in
        blue, respectively. A Swell wave roughly consists of Sea State
        waves. Swell is described by both length (red horizontal
        arrow) and height (red vertical arrow) of the wave, while Sea
        State is determined only by the height (blue vertical
        arrow). </p>

	<figure class="centered_image">

	  </center>
	  <figcaption>Fig 1. A ship on the sea. The red big wave
	  indicates the Swell state of the sea while the blue small
	  wave indicates the "Sea State" of the sea. There are 4
	  sensors located at the forward (red), middle (green, only
	  one of them is shown in the figure), and aft (blue). </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<br>
	<p class ="lead"> The captain on the ship reports the sea
	conditions with daily the codes on both Swell and Sea
	State. For example, the captain could report the Swell and Sea
	State as "04 MODERATE SWELL Height, AVERAGE Length" and "03
	SLIGHT Sea State Height".
	</p>

	<p class ="lead"> Using the data from the draft sensors,
	located at forward, middle, and aft (shown as red, green, and
	blue boxes in Fig 1.), we want to reconstruct the wave
	structure for both Swell and Sea State. By correlating the
	wave information obtained from the draft sensors to the
	captain's daily report at a given time, we wish to build a
	model to determine the sea state with the Swell and Sea State
	codes.
	</p>
	
	<h2>2. Data Challenges and Solutions</h2>
	<h3>2.1. Challenges </h3>
        <p class="lead"> The first thing to verify is whether we
          can see a wave structure from the draft sensor readings.
          However, as shown in Fig. 2, it is not possible to see any
          wave-like structure from the draft sensors. We need to think
          of other features which reflect the sea conditions rather
          than try to fully reconstruct the wave.</p>

	<figure class="centered_image">
	  <center>
	  <img src="static/draft_sensor_with_wave.png" width="500px" >
	  </center>
	  <figcaption>Fig 2. 60 seconds of the forward draft sensor
	    reading (light blue dots) and possible wave with a
	    wavelength of 200 m (dark blue solid line). The sampling
	    frequency for the sensor data is ~ 1 S/s.  As shown in
	    this example, no obvious wave like structure is
	    shown. </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br>
	<p class ="lead">
	Another challenge is the very small number of captain's daily
	reports. The captain's daily log is available from April 14,
	2017, and only two months of data has been accumulated as of
	Jun 25, 2017. In addition, the dataset has to be split into
	two cases depending on the cargo conditions. When a cargo ship
	is not loaded with cargo and in the "ballast" state, the
	ship's weight is about two times lighter and the draft sensors
	yield smaller water depth values.  Also, in the ballast state,
	the ship is tilted (cargo is loaded at the aft of the ship)
	and the forward sensor is always reading a higher value than
	the aft sensor. In total, we have 32 and 21 captain's log
	available for the ballast and laden (the ship is fully loaded
	with cargo) states, respectively. Even if we choose the
	ballast state, these 32 data points are spread into 5 (4)
	categories for Swell (Sea State) codes as shown in Fig 3. We
	do not have any data avaialble with more extreme conditions
	with higher code values.

	  ballast state. 32 data points are spread into 5 (4) different
	  categories for Swell (Sea State) codes. </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3>2.2. Solutions</h3>
	<p class ="lead"> To tackle the challenge that the draft
	sensor did not exhibit wave-like structure, I designed a
	feature which could be sensitive to sea conditions.  The most
	natural guess was that when the sea condition is extreme, the
	ship will be shakier and the draft sensor value itself will
	fluctuate more. Indeed the data supported this guess. Also,
	given that the ship is tiled in the ballast state, the
	difference between two sensors, especially between forward and
	aft sensors, would be most sensitive to any fluctuation of the
	ship. Therefore, I came up with a feature defined as the
	standard deviation of the difference between forward and aft
	sensors, normalized by the mean of the differnece. To obtain
	the standard deviation and the mean, I merged the samples
	within 150 seconds. I assumed that the sea condition stayed
	the same within two hours (which gives me 48 data points) and
	took the mean of the distribution as the feature.</p>

	<p class ="lead"> The second thing I did was reframe the
	problem as a binomial logistic regression problem (sea is calm
	or moderate) rather than a multinomial logistic regression
	problem (swell codes ranges from 0 to 4). Some of the
	categories have only one or two entries and 32 data points are
	not enough to perform multinomial logistic regression. </p>

	<p class ="lead"> Lastly, I decided to use probablistic
	programming using Bayesian inference for this specific
	problem. Rather than divide the datasets into training and
	test datasets, using all the data to build the model and
	verify it with Monte Carlo simultion based on the posterior
	seemed to be a better approach. In addition, this method
	provides not only the probability that the sea is moderate but
	also the associated uncertainty of the probability. With
	limited statistics, I think it is more important to provide
	proper uncertainty of the classification. </p>
	
	<h2>3. Model</h2>
	<h3> 3.1 The sea is calm or moderate? </h3>
	<p class ="lead">
	Once we reframe the problem as a binomial logistic regression
	problem, we can describe the probability of the sea being
	moderate as a function of the feature described in Section
	2.2. I used the PyMC3 package and used the Metropolis-Hasting
	algorithm to obtain the posterior distribution of the two
	coefficients in the logisitc function.

	Fig 4. shows the data points (shown as gray dots) along with
	the average posterior (shown as a blue line), and two specific
	cases of obtained posterior selections after burning
	a million samples. The blue line is the deliverable of this
	project!</p>

	  <img src="static/ch3_average_posterior.png" width="800px" >

	  <figcaption>Fig 4. The probability of the sea being moderate
	  as a function of the feature described in Sec. 2.2. Gray dots,
	  blue line, green and red dashed lines indicate the data
	  points, the logistic function obtained from the average
	  posterior, and two cases obtained from the posterior
	  distribution, respectively. </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3> 3.2 How good was the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling? </h3>
	<p class ="lead">
	To obtain reasonable posterior distributions, I have generated
	1000000 samples, burned 150000 of them, and used a thin of
	10. As shown in Fig. 5, the optimization of the posterior
	obtainment was successful (no discrete structure in both
	posterior distributions as well as trace evolution.) </p>

	  </center>
	  <figcaption>Fig 5. Trace plots to obtain the posterior distributions. </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3> 3.3 What is the uncertainty on the probability of
	  determining the sea conditions? </h3>
	<p class ="lead">
	Since we have the posterior distributions on the model, we can
	also obtain the associate uncertainty on the probability of
	the sea being moderate. Fig 6 shows 95% Confidence Interval
	(C.I.) of the probability with purple band. C.I. means 95% of
	the posterior distribution lies within the band. As shown in
	the figure, we can be certain that the sea is calm where the
	feature value is below 0.06, as well as above 0.14 the sea is
	moderate. However, at the value around 0.11, the C.I. provides
	wildy varying values from ~ 0.02 to 1, while the probability
	of being in the moderate state is 0.8. Basically we are not
	able to robustly classify the sea condition as calm or
	moderate when the observed feature value lies between 0.10 and
	0.12. </p>

	  <figcaption>Fig 6. 95% Confindence Interval (C.I.) of the
	  probability estimate of the sea being
	  moderate. </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3> 3.4 How good is the model? </h3>
	<p class ="lead">
	  To verify that the model is good, we can generate an
	  aritificial dataset using the info obtained from the
	  posterior and make a comparison with the observations we
	  have. The idea here is that if the simulated data is not
	  similar to the observation statistically, our model does not
	  represent the data correctly. We can think that the
	  observation is a specific case of the posterior
	  distributions and see how probable it is statistically. </p>

	<p class="lead"> Fig 7. shows three models to get an idea
	about how good our model (top) is.  For each model, we
	calculate the proportion of times the posterior simulation is
	a value of 1 for a particular feature value. It gives the
	posterior probability of the sea being moderate at each data
	point. If we sort them by the posterior probability, we obtain
	the plot where the occurence of the sea being moderate is
	indicated as a blue box and the probability of the sea being
	moderate is shown as a horizontal black line, while the
	vertical line shows the threshold separating calm and moderate
	conditions. This separation plot also allows the user to see
	how the total number of events predicted by the model compares
	to the actual number of events in the data.</p>

	<p class="lead">
	  The perfect model would predict the sea being moderate with
	probability 1 for the occurence of the sea being moderate and
	0 for the sea being calm as shown in the middle plot of Fig
	7. For random probability distribution for the sea being
	moderate, it will just randomly occur at any probability
	order. As we can see in Fig 7, the feature-dependent model
	yields the occurence of the sea being moderate correctly right
	to the separation line.</p>

	  in Sec. 3.1 (top), the perfect model (middle), and the
	  random probability model (bottom). </figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3> 3.5 What could be improved? </h3>
	<p class ="lead">
	There are several things that could be improved for the current
	analysis but the main requirement is having more data in the
	Captain's log. We could consider increasing the corresponding
	data points for each captain's log by having multiple values
	for the feature mentioned in Sec. 2.2. by enlarging the time window
	and separating different time slots (e.g., instead
	of looking at 1 feature value obtained within 2 hours, we
	could obtain 3 values with a 1 hour separation in 3
	hours). However, given that we are already using the mean
	behavior of the feature within a certain time window, it would
	not change the probability distribution function significantly
	with the current Bayesian approach. It might be more suitiable
	for the other approaches such as random forest and could be
	interesting to compare the results. </p>

	<p class ="lead">
	Once we have more data we could go back and try to perform
	multinomial logistic regression. In addition to multinomial
	logistic regression, we could consider ordinal regression
	too.</p>

	<p class ="lead">
	  Lastly, given that we did not observe any wave structure
	  with the existing sensors, it could be worth taking data
	  with other types of sensors. One of the limitations of the
	  current sensor data comes from the fact that the ship
	  dimension is often larger than the Swell wave length and it
	  would not be easy to see the smaller structure. It might be
	  more useful to have a small vessel instrumented with the
	  sensors which could see the wave structure for both Swell
	  and Sea State. Also, we can think of completely different
	  types of sensors such as gyroscopes or image processing of
	  a sattelite image of the sea around the ship.
	</p>
	
	<h2>4. Business Applications</h2>	
        <p class="lead"> The model used for this analysis can be
        applied to any problem with small labeled data for
        classification. For example, it can be used to determine
        car failure rate using the sensor reading on the car. Another
        use could be to determine health insurance plans for rare
        diseases. Startup company marketing advice with limited
        initial statistics could be an application too.</p>
